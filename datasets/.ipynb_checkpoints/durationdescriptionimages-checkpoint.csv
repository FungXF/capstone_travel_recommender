I am therefore left waiting at the dock for 50 minutes; a dock that has no facilities and doesn’t even have seating. When talking to the tour sales agent at the dock and their management office over the phone, they confirm that they know the tour times advertised on Trip Advisor are incorrect. Apparently, it’s OK that the times are mis-represented because it’s not their fault that Trip Advisor won’t show the correct time. I found their attitude of “oh well, too bad for you but it is what it is” extremely disrespectful. Clearly they get a lot of ticket sales through Trip Advisor so they continue to sell through there, but they don’t care that customers are mis-sold to. They didn’t even try to be accommodating.

Leave yourself enough time to navigate here! Second, be warned: the “practice” run you get is short and nothing compared to your first REAL run from a platform in the trees, so if you’re newbies at this activity,know what you’re getting into! I thought the guide, Christian, was very kind and patient given he helped our youngest through the entire course and never seemed to complain, even when he had to double back to help me through a few runs as well. It didn’t help that some of us are scared of heights and clearly in over our heads physically for what is deemed/advertised as a “family activity”. We definitely could have used some more practice. Third, the bison experience is underwhelming and literally a few minutes observing them in the field. It was nothing, to be honest, and while they were nice to look at, it was just that: something to look at. My biggest, final concern or point of review that makes this “mixed” (if not borderline atrocious) is that my youngest reported that she overheard the guide telling someone else on the course that he was going to “kill me”, which I can only presume meant “leave the course” (which I was prepared to do given my fear of heights), however this phraseology was wildly inappropriate and has left my youngest feeling frightened and anxious ever since. This final point leaves us all feeling weird /let down about the whole experience. While some of us may not have been cut out for the entire zip lining experience, we were sure to tip our guide as thanks for his expertise, patience and and assistance- however I’m second guessing how helpful he really was if my kid is a nervous wreck. I don’t think I would recommend this for anyone under 10 and overall feel that there should be a but more training to prepare for the course.",2h,"background-image: url(""https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-720x480/06/6c/6a/01.jpg"");"

You can see 4-7 people at the platforms in the air standing 18 inches or less from each other. No they were not all from the same family or group, and it was in practically in every platform where you would see someone hesitating a little to live forward, as people catch up with that slower people, they got jammed and close to each other. The employees made ZERO effort to control people to maintain spacing and avoiding getting more than 2 people at one platform. Plenty of space for 2 people to socially distance at the platforms, but not much for more than that. The management of a business is responsible to ENFORCE social distancing within their business, or their business licence can be suspended. Within the first 60 minutes of being there, after the kids getting their safety harnesses, it was clear to us that this place will be the best COVID-19 breakout among young people as well as adults.
I give them this... they do make it look as if they want to keep people safe, since there is sanitizer at the start of each section, but that only works as long as people don’t touch their noses, mouths, eyes. I saw people sneezing, laughing, screaming, and talking loudly as they were attaching or moving forward on the equipment. Never saw any of their employees go up on any of the sections, wiping anything with any sort of antibacterial product. Making it look like it’s clean and safe, isn’t the same as making sure it is clean & safe.

Another thing I noticed... they have some very knowledgeable employees there... which is clear on some. Strong leaders and very capable to help someone be safe, BUT they have very weak employees doing the safety class at the start of the course. Why is that??? It should be one of the strong leaders doing this job!!. I saw this young male teaching people how to attach to the equipment and the basic things you need to know, so you don’t plummet to your death or a life altering injuring (all to which you sign a waiver to, including if it is the staff negligence that causes the accident or equipment failure!!!).
He mumbled it all to himself, and unfortunately, it was a bunch of young kids in the group I saw him teaching. Obviously the majority of them didn’t understand how to do things because after 10 minutes another member had to come and explain it all again. I was concerned when I saw this. Also while there, I noticed some areas weren’t manned. There were users on the equipment, but no staff at the bottom paying attention if there was Any issues or anything like assisting people that got stuck... and boy are there any.... at least 40% of the people have issues moving forward either because the harness is stuck or because they are afraid.
Anyway,

I wouldn’t come back until they change the way they do things, and the WAIVER doesn’t make staff negligence and equipment failure an okay thing. I’m having a lawyer look at the contract closely to see if we can start a class action against this place, so that in the very least they are forced to change the staff negligence and equipment failure. If it’s user mistake, oh well.... but if the staff member they put to do the safety portion of the education to the user , is the weakest most insecure person mumbling gibberish.... you are creating a safety issue there, and should be made responsible for whatever may happen.

Wouldn’t recommend if you care about your safety.",1h,"background-image: url(""https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-720x480/06/70/18/ae.jpg"");"

1319,https://tripadvisor.ca/AttractionProductDetail-g155019-d11465986-Winter_Special_Niagara_Falls_Tour_from_Toronto-Toronto_Ontario.html,"To summarise: This was a good trip that took us to all the stops it promised and basically did what it said on the tin.

The day started with a pickup from where we were staying (at a friends house slightly out of the downtown area) which was convenient (although they arrived early and we didn't receive a call to say they were coming/arrived which would have been helpful), and then taken to their office where we waited for 45 minutes before setting off in a different vehicle.
There were 21 of us on the day we did the trip, and we were taken in a small but modern coach that had heating, air con and wifi (not that I tried it out). Our tour guide, Salim, was friendly, helpful and funny, although it was at times a bit difficult to hear what he was saying, and we were only a couple of seats from the front. However, he went out of his way to check we were happy and understood when to meet etc, and was accommodating during drop offs.
The first stop was a large souvenir shop about 5 minutes from Niagara Falls where we were given 15 minutes to look around, along with a 10% discount voucher - fine if you're after a souvenir, but a bit annoying and unnecessary if not (who wants to buy a souvenir of a place you haven't been to yet?!) - I can only assume there's some sort of deal between the shop and King Tours but it wasn't made clear if there was. It was a good toilet break however!
We then stopped at Niagara Falls for 2.5hours which was probably enough time - the falls themselves are spectacular, but the rest of the attractions are mostly casinos, fast food places and kids entertainment - there's good reason Niagara Falls is known as Vegas of Canada.
Next up was a lovely town called Niagara on the Lake - we were dropped right in town and given 45 minutes - I wish we had been given longer as it was such a charming town but we only got as far as 3 shops in that time. I'd like to see the stop at the souvenir store taken out, and the time added here.
The last stop was at a winery where we got to sample three different types of wine - one white, and two ice wines, and were told a bit about the process of making the ice wines.

Pros: A comfortable modern coach, friendly tour guide, and the falls!
Cons: An unnecessary stop, and bad communication/organisation before the tour got started.

All in all a good day out that I'd recommend to friends.",9h,"background-image: url(""https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-720x480/07/35/80/47.jpg"");"

We probably went back and went through Sailor Bar 6 times or more! It was a great way to end the trip. When not hitting the rapids, the canyon is a constant beautiful backdrop, so lay back on the raft and enjoy the views!

All the staff we came across, from ""check in"" to the end of the day were all super friendly, helpful and patient with our questions, which I'm sure they get over and over again.

We were given wind jackets and pants, as well as a lifejacket of course, which was really convenient if you don't have that kind of gear yourself. They also supplied dry bags for us to put our dry clothes in so that we would have dry clothes to change in to at the end of the trip.

Small touches, like supplying us with ice cold water at the end of the trip, were much appreciated and thoughtful.

My only suggestion/idea for improvement would be to look into whether it is possible to have the lunch sandwiches pre-made by the kitchen staff at the resort the morning of, as opposed to prepping a sandwich station during the trip. Just seems like it would save some time.

All in all, an awesome trip with friends. I would definitely go through Kumsheen again for the other rafting options.",7h,"background-image: url(""https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-720x480/06/7b/29/2a.jpg"");"

One with this company and one with the tour guide. First the good, our tour of Toronto by car was interesting and gave us a great overview of the city including some of the hidden neighborhoods. Our tour guide was personable & had great energy.

Now the bad...the logistics of getting this tour to actually happen was a nightmare. I called to set up our hotel pick up and the receptionist said that my family would have to walk to a remote location because they didn’t provide pickup service at my hotel. Huh? This was advertised as a private tour and included hotel pick up. When I explained as much she stated I should call viatour because it was between me and this “third party”. I stated that the mix up was on her company’s end so she needed to clear it up.

A few minutes later she went from very dismissive to very accommodating because she “found” my booking and I had “surprise, surprise” booked a private tour with hotel pick up. Why she hadn’t looked at the beginning of the call I’ll never know. We scheduled for a 10 am pick up the next morning But nothing with this company can be that smooth. I got a call that the guide was here for pickup at 9 am. The operator had given the tour guide the wrong time. Wow.

However, as stated in the beginning once the tour started the guide saved to entire experience from being a disaster. Logistics terrible, tour excellent. Overall average.",2h 30m,"background-image: url(""https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-720x480/06/fd/ac/c1.jpg"");"
