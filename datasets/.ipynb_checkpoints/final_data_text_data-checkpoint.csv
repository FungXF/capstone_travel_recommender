Good food, great company, easy-listening music and a wonderful evening. This was a lovely way to spend an evening in Vancouver. Wonderful Scenery - Good Food.

The birds were beautiful and many of them were walking or standing on the same pathways... A truly enchanted kingdom!. I didn't even know about the Bird Kingdom until I was already in Ontario but as soon as I saw the pamphlet, I knew I had to go. This is the coolest animal encounter experience I've ever had. So many birds of all shapes and... Bird Kingdom is Fun and Fascinating!. We have been to Bird Kingdom several times, while in Niagara Falls. It is fascinating to see all the birds.

You can just sit back and let the birds fly around you. 3 Schools were going through, but they did not stay long. Amazing variety of birds. You can easily spend 2 or 3 hours watching the birds. There is a smaller enclosure... Saw the birds. Entry seems reasonable until you find out they won't let you or someone else take pictures with the birds for sole purpose of trying to sell you pictures when you are leaving. More Than I Thought it Would Be!. This has been on my boyfriend and I's to-do list for the last year or so, as we've been to the Falls many times but never made it here. We went yesterday, and we were both beyond surprised with how much it had to offer.... Bird visit. Enjoyed seeing the birds roam. Took. Picture with a parrot and the final portion of the tour was the best. Keep that in mind because the initial museum was kinda lame. So much fun for Bird Lovers!.

Cowboy Colin greeted us at the entrance and was very helpful and friendly.... Very interesting and enjoyable!.

Amazing place for kids and adult!!. I went to Bird Kingdom last week with my 2 kids and my wife. I would like to share my experience about this place. It was clean and well decorated for Halloween.

I love birds, and not just for being birds, but for the beauty and richness they bring to our world and to our life.

We did not plan to visit but being a very cold rainy day we had to find something indoors for the kids and we chose the Bird Kingdom.\nWe all loved it! It is a great place to see and learn about lots of birds.... a good way to spend a few hours. This was a nice interesting place with birds flying freely all around you. They are very colorful and have interesting sounds. There are many different areas that have caged bats, reptiles and different animals. There is a gift shop naturally where you can buy souvieners.... Fun indoor Attraction . Fun attraction to do with kids especially if the weather is not cooperating. Not a big location so not an all day visit, very manageable. My son loved the open aviary. Buy tickets online or look for Groupon to save a few bucks Well worth the visit.. Was in Niagra with my wife while making our way to Toronto. My wife has two parrots and of course, loves birds so we had to stop here. I will say the birds here were in the top three most beautiful things to see in... All the amazing birds. Stopped at the Bird Kingdom on the last day of our vacation. Was surprised when we got to learn about Niagara Falls history before seeing all the birds. The smaller aviary was full of cute birds and some reptiles. I got to hold a macaw... Fun Activity. The Bird Kingdom offers more than just birds. First you get on a tour through different rooms while listening to a narrator, providing a story leading up to seeing the birds. The rooms also include some local history about Niagara Falls and it's residents.\nEventually... Cool to seem some nice colourful birds... I liked it, Has a very big room with birds flying everywhere.. Lots of colourful birds.. Had some smaller rooms for the smaller birds too... Even a bat cave room... There are stairs and a few floors.. The one main big room was nice with... This place sucked. It was like walking through a pet store that had opened up all the cages. Poor design, expensive, would not recommend. Larger than expected!. This was a really different place for us. We had a great time looking at all that this place had to offer. While we didn't get to hold as many birds as we thought we would have it was still great. We did get pictures... A place to see unusual birds close up. 3 levels of reptiles and birds. A must to see for bird lovers. One parrot sings opera and remembers 2000 words.\nI love the new guinea crowned pigeon. Great place to photograph birds close up. Back in Time. This place is something that could have been right out of the 1950's Niagara Falls attractions, and probably was there then. Site is old and in need of updating and maintenance. Okay for little kids as they can be occupied with seeing some birds, but... This one isn't just for the birds.. This was my second visit to Bird Kingdom because I enjoyed it so much the first time. My first visit was about a decade ago, so a few things had changed. The place is much busier now, but not so busy that it was overcrowded... Groupon helped bring us back!.

We spent nearly 2 hours wandering around and looking at the birds. There are 2 spots where you can hold birds - one with large macaws/parrots/etc and another room with lorikeets. My... Wow.. Let me start off by saying I am not a bird fanatic. Nonetheless this place was great. All different kinds of birds in a close up and personal atmosphere. Better than any bird exhibit at any zoo I have visited. Opportunities to talk to the... nice. i was there and it was my long visit oafter whole day.love the birds and everythngin.gotta tell u ur child goin to like it Beautiful aviary. Second visit. Much busier in summer during tourist season. . I love the big aviary at the end , lots of beautiful birds and pink flamingos. The bat exhibit is also neat and love the turtles. Takes about 1.5 hour to walk through. They frequently... Great Hands on Experience. We visited not knowing a lot about the attraction and were pleasantly surprised! The keepers were very kind and in one of the aviaries they will put a parrot on your arm and you actually are allowed to hold them independently. Unfortunately they don't allow... Excellent day trip. My family took a trip into the falls just to see this place. My daughter is a bird lover and she was enthralled. I was expecting just the main aviary, but was pleasantly surprised by the three other bird areas, plus a section of an... Great Museum and Bird Avairy!. My family visited bird kingdom during our vacation to Niagara Falls, Ontario. Wow what a treat! It was an amazing mix of museum, history, archeology, and of course the main bird aviary. Look for groupon deals before visiting for great prices. My wife, 10, 8,... Truly amazing. We always love to visit anything with animals and this place didn't disappoint. The beginning was about Niagara history and we were almost wondering if we were in the right place. But that was quickly forgotten about when we got into the bird enclosures. The... Gross Place. We were given free tickets because the place we wanted to go to wasn't available, otherwise we would never have set foot in this disgusting place. It was truly horrible.\nThe small bird enclosure was ridiculous. The birds were just flying around, freaking out because... Fabulous place, beautiful critters!. Well-presented and very attractive layout. Good diversity of healthy birds, reptiles, amphibians (love the tortoises), and even two skunks!\nOnly minus was the the cafe had almost nothing (just hot dogs; yuck and so unhealthy) so we had to go elsewhere for lunch and coffee. Great interactive visit. It was interesting to see all of the different birds. The highlight was definitely feeding the lorikeets. It was fun until you ran out of food. My 14 year old was bitten on the back of his neck (on a mole, which bled a lot).... Birds love it. We had loads of fun in there.\nToo many birds for the kids had great time. Surely recommend this to everyone Great visit. As we started our tour of the place I was not really impressed and didn't know what to expect but at the end when you can see the birds flying around you and especially so many different types, so close, it was an awesome experience.... Great Aviary, Poor Exhibits. Bird Kingdom is pretty much a tourist trap. It is not without certain charms, but overall, the space is contrived in the sense that its reason for being is a little artificial, and that’s reflected in the structure of the facility. Visitors are guided in... Very fun!. My girls are 6 and they loved this place. The aviary was done very well with lots of beautiful vignettes and waterfalls. The first floor was also fun because of the bats, tarantulas and other animals.I really like that the bird feeding area was not... alot of fun but expensive. This place is fun but the admission spot and the gift shop are all being managed by one employee. We waited 30 minutes to pay to get in. It was fun inside and the main aviary is beautiful. Also, skip the first floor bathroom, it...",https://tripadvisor.ca/AttractionProductDetail-g154998-d12181670-Bird_Kingdom_All_Day_Admission_Ticket-Niagara_Falls_Ontario.html,sightseeing_tickets_&_passes,experience,activities,,,,,,,,,,

Then had to leave to be ahead of rush hour traffic Will go back again when it... Fantastic zoo to visit with snow all around. Love penguins and the daily penguin walk was so unique. Pandas fun too. All in all, a great zoo, Visiting in winter meant a lot of shops and food outlets were closed as it is the slow e eason however the animals were still there... Great family outing. In the summer we spent an entire day at the zoo with may of our family. We were ages from 2 to 70 and never once got bored or tired of being there.

It was not my first Via Ferrata but one of the best. Guide Maya was really good and we had a lot of fun. We walked through snow to do the Via Ferrata but it was... Amazing trip!. This is one of the best activities which I have done in Whistler! After a small hike through the snow you start climbing the mountain - and the views are fantastic. I am not a huge fan of heights but I felt safe and comfortable... Amazing Hike!. Thanks so much Tyler and Maya for a wonderful hike. The views are beautiful and the ""via ferrata"" was challenging, while at the same time you feel safe as you scramble up the near vertical cliffs. Thanks again for a wonderful afternoon. Amazing.

After waiting far longer than the published 20 minutes for the first... Very poor tour experience-Somewhat of a Waste of Money.

Jean Michel absolutely made our trip- we took the combined east and west tours and his exuberance for Montreal and Quebec provincece’s history spread to the group and put us all in a great mood despite the cold. I would highly recommend anyone and everyone... Great way to learn about the city. We did both tours with Jean Michael. He was a fantastic guide and it was a great way to learn about the city. We learned a lot! It was very cold, colder than I expected, so if you are doing this tour in the winter... Perfect way to learn about and see Old Montreal. I did the 3hr East and West walking tour with Jean Michael and it was fantastic! He was so funny, kind, and extremely knowledgable. The pace was not too fast and it was fun to go down side streets and see/hear the history of your... Good time on a icy morning. Tour guide was fun and kept the group organized and moving along. She knew a lot about the city and obviously enjoys it. It was not that easy because the streets and sidewalks were terribly icy. So much fun. We had an amazing tour guide for our walking tour, she knew SO much history. She also had a lot of fun facts to share, which kept the tour very interesting. I highly recommend this tour, it is a great way to learn about Montreal! Excellent!!!!. Jean Michel was fabulous! Knowledgeable, funny, and very happy to share his love of Montreal and Quebec with us! His accent actually made the tour for us - brought together the French/English of Montreal and the history of this beautiful city. He even made sure... Very worthwhile tour!. Our guide, Leslie, was great, and my teenage son (notoriously hard to impress) and I both enjoyed the tour. There had been 15 inches of snow earlier in the week so it was snowy and icy but that didn't detract from anything. Awesome Tour of the Old City!. Really enjoyed this Tour! Our guide knew the city and history extremely well. He added a few more inside spots to warm up from the weather, that morning. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone who wants to see and learn about Old Montreal... Amazing tour!. We had a great time at the walking tour of old Montreal (East). It was very scenic and beautiful. Pierre (tour guide) has a great sense of humour and is very knowledgeable about this beautiful city. It was quite cold, however, very worth it because... Romantic. Definitely a must to do if you want to experience a romantic time in Montreal. Very affordable and worth the experience. Make sure to book ahead as I would guess they sell out fast! Highly recommended! very enjoyable. Even though it was bitterly cold and windy even for us Minnesotans we thoroughly enjoyed our tour. Our guide Andre kept us moving and entertained throughout, and got us indoors to warm up as much as he could. We did the East tour in the... Nice tour.

Awesome experience suitable for all ages. Three generations of our family did it (15-68yrs) and we had a superb experience together as a family, highly recommend it and the company as they were very helpful and well natured especially at the actual Ziplining area :) Hamish and Lochie (Australians) were so... Amazing activity - the best team. Thank you so much all the superfly team, its a pleasure to spend a day doing something so fun with people, who are obviously happy with their job and they know what they are doing. It was amazing and you guys are professionals. Adventure of a Lifetime. It is a definite MUST DO! Honestly if you've ever thought of it, JUST DO IT! It doesn't take as much courage as one may think. I would never bungee jump or parachute, but this is a surprisingly calming flying effect of an adventure! No... Dangerous. Poorly engineered. No break. Avoid!. I've done numerous ziplines in other places. This was the first one without a break. Users just crash into the emergency stop springs. It's probably fine for kids and small adults, but full size men should avoid it. On the fastest line, the momentum whipped... Wow, worth it.. I admit that I was pretty worried after reading about the zip line that was 500 m high and from one mountain to another and that you would go 100 km/hour. But once I was off and going, it was easy and super fun. The... Just Do It!!. This was possibly highlight of our Rockies trip. The staff are welcoming and fun and make you feel really safe. I've done zippiness before but not on this scale, my wife however has never done anything like this and I never thought she would at... OMG! What a thrill!. This was my first time on a zip line and will not be my last! Everything from the lively base camp to the jeep ride up the mountain to the breathtaking zip across the trees was perfect. The only thing that could have been better... Awesome Adventure, Even if You're Afraid of Heights!!!. I have to admit I was nervous, not only for myself, but also my 9- and 10-year old kids. Joseph and Petra put our fears to rest quickly and those feelings of anxiety quickly changed to excitement. A great time indeed and there is no... Exhilarating . Great way to spend half a day in the mountains, exciting way to enjoy the forest. 100% professional and friendly in every way, safety is paramount! I really enjoyed it even though I'm scared of heights!! Thoroughly recommended! Best tips for having an incredible Ziplining adventure at Whistler Superfly Ziplines. My wife and I love Ziplining and we choose Whistler Superfly Ziplines as it came highly recommended by the concierge at the Westin Hotel. We were thrilled that we took his advice because we had an incredible time as the runs are long, fast and... Yes, yes, yes. I was hesitant...actually scared to death - but I conquered my fear and did the zipline. Hands down would do it again! Crazy awesome experience with amazing views and words cannot describe it. If I had to pick out of the activities there to do,... Best Ever!!. Highly recommend this activity. Husband and I went as first timers and was even better than expected. Both guides where amazing, explained everything very clearly and you could see they loved their job. Zip lines where so cool, my fav was Godzilla, you can go... Definite MUST DO!. This was the highlight of our trip! I travel to Whistler at least twice a year and can say with confidence, I will do this every time now! Absolutely loved it! SOOO much fun.
